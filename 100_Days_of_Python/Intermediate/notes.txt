OOP
- Objects have things and the things that they can do.
- waiter:
  - attributes: is_holding_plate = True
                tables_responsible = [4,5,6]
    methods: def take_order(table, order):
             def take_payment(amount)
(object)->car.speed<-(attribute)
Classes allow you to generate as many objects as you want

Dictionaries are unordered
List are ordered
